      <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p><img src="javascript.jpg" width="500" height="300"><p>JavaScript was first known as <strong>LiveScript</strong>, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name <strong>LiveScript</strong>. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>
